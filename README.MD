# NZSG-GAN
This code runs a GAN based on the network zero-sum framework (see [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.05477.pdf)). The GAN consists of three networks --- a classifer, a discriminator, and a generator. The goal of NZSG-GAN is to train a generator to inteliigently integrate two different styles for image generation.
